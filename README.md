# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This website is a work day scheduler. It allows you to to keep track of your work day from 9-5pm. You can save important events within each time slot by clicking on the save icon button on the right hand side of the page. The slots change color based on what time it is. If it is present time the slot will be red. If it is past the current time the slot will be grey. And lastly, if it is in the future the slot will be green.
